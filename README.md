I recently developed a personal portfolio website using React.js to showcase my skills and projects as a Full Stack Developer. 
The project involved creating a dynamic and responsive UI with React, where I utilized useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects effectively. 
I implemented form validations on the contact form to ensure data integrity and used NavLink for smooth navigation throughout the site. This project reflects my hands-on experience in 
front-end development and my commitment to delivering stylish and user-friendly web applications.
